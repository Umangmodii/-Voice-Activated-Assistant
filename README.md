Description:

Developed a voice-activated assistant using Python, inspired by the functionality of Jarvis from Iron Man. The project integrates various modules to provide a range of functionalities, making it an interactive and hands-free assistant.

Key Features:

- Speech Recognition : Implemented speech recognition using the SpeechRecognition library to convert user voice commands into actionable text.
- Text-to-Speech : Utilized the pyttsx3 library to enable the assistant to respond audibly, creating a natural interaction experience.
- Time and Greetings : Incorporated a feature to greet the user based on the current time of day, creating a personalized touch.
- Wikipedia Integration : Integrated Wikipedia search functionality, allowing users to inquire about information on various topics.
- Web Browsing : Enabled the assistant to open specified websites, such as YouTube, Google, and Stack Overflow, using the webbrowser module.
- Email Sending Capability : Implemented a feature allowing the assistant to send emails with user-specified content to a designated recipient.

Technologies Used:

- Python
- pyttsx3 (Text-to-Speech library)
- SpeechRecognition (Speech recognition library)
- smtplib (for sending emails)
- Wikipedia API (for retrieving information)

Challenges Overcome:

- Overcame challenges related to speech recognition accuracy and handled exceptions for better user experience.
- Implemented error handling to address potential issues with sending emails.

Achievements:

- Successfully created a functional and interactive voice-activated assistant, enhancing user convenience and accessibility.
- Demonstrated problem-solving skills by addressing challenges in speech recognition and email sending functionalities.

Future Enhancements:

- Explore additional voice commands and functionalities to expand the capabilities of the assistant.
- Implement natural language processing for more context-aware interactions.Description:
